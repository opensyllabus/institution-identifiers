# Institution Identifiers
Educational &amp; Research institutions mapping between ROR, GRID, IPEDs, and Wikidata

## Schema

`ror_id`: [Research Organization Registry](https://ror.org/) (ROR) identifier.

`grid_id`: [Global Research Identifier Database](https://www.grid.ac/) (GRID) identifier. GRID has been deprecated and superseded by ROR.

`wikidata_id`: [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) identifier. Used for creating the crosswalk between identifiers.

`unitid`: [Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds) (IPEDS) identifier. US institutions only.

`name`: Name of the institution. There may be errors or different from other records.

## Things to note

For ROR, we only work with educational institutions at the moment ie) `type="Education"`
